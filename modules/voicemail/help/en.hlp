<h1>{$node_name}</h1>

<p>The option "Voicemail" of the Menu “PBX” in Issabel lets us view a list with details of the voicemails for the extension of the logged user.</p>

<br />

<p>The report will change depending on the values of the filter:</p>

<table class="inline">
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Start Date</td><td>Start date for the selection of voicemails.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>End Date</td><td>End date for the selection of voicemails.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>
<p>To delete a voicemail, just select the voicemail from the list and click on "Delete" button.</p>
<br />
<h2>Configuring the Voicemail</h2>
<p>You can also configure the parameters of the voicemail provided the logged user has an assigned extension in Issabel.</p>
